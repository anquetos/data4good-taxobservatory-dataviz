Data For Good is a 1901 association created in 2014 that brings together a community of 4000+ tech volunteers (Data Scientists, Data Analysts, Data Engineers, Developers, UX/UI Designers, Product & Project Owners) wishing to put their skills to work for associations, NGOs, and the SSE - and to commit themselves to the general interest.

Each year, Data For Good organizes acceleration seasons during which a dozen or so projects are supported by volunteers on social, societal and environmental themes.

The EU Tax Observatory is one of season 12's projects, which aims to compile data on the location of multinationals' profits, in order to gain a better understanding of tax evasion and aggressive tax optimization. One of the project's goals is to make this data accessible and understandable to everyone with a website where the data can be downloaded, viewed and explored interactively.
